SIO2Arduino is an open-source implementation of the Atari SIO device protocol that runs on Arduino hardware. Arduino hardware is open-source and can be assembled by hand or purchased preassembled.

Note: You will need the SdFat library (https://github.com/greiman/SdFat) in your Arduino libraries directory in order to compile.
This has been tested using SdFat version 2.1.2.
